## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a soon to be 'Frontend Developer' student at Medieinstitutet. 
I just finished HTML/CSS and JavaScript - basics. 

I decided to make this password generator to improve and learn more about JavaScript.


# Password Generator

This is a password generator made in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
You should be able to generate a password that contains either or all:
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Symbols

You should also be able to copy the generated password to your clipboard by clicking on the copy-button that appears when you hover over the textarea.
